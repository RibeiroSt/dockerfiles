Run a test_sshd container
-------------------------

Then run it. You can then use docker port to find out what host port the container's port 22 is mapped to:

$ sudo docker run -d -P --name test_sshd eg_sshd
$ sudo docker port test_sshd 22
0.0.0.0:49154

And now you can ssh as root on the container's IP address (you can find it with docker inspect) or on port 49154 of the Docker daemon's host IP address (ip address or ifconfig can tell you that) or localhost if on the Docker daemon host:

$ ssh root@192.168.1.2 -p 49154
# The password is ``screencast``.
$$


Clean up
--------

Finally, clean up after your test by stopping and removing the container, and then removing the image.

$ sudo docker stop test_sshd
$ sudo docker rm test_sshd
$ sudo docker rmi eg_sshd
